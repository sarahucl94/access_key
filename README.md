# access_key

Produce an access key for each participant that fills in a questionnaire in 2 parts. After being screened for eligibility in part 1
you generate an automatic access key and send it to them, so they can fill in part 2 anonymously, as per GDPR regulations.

You save name and access key of the participant in a file that you can encrypt on your computer, to match participant and access key later on.
